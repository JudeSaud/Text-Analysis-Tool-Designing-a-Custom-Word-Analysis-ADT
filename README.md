# Text-Analysis-Tool-Designing-a-Custom-Word-Analysis-ADT

This project involved creating a robust text analysis tool in Java with a custom WordAnalysis ADT. The tool was designed to efficiently handle a variety of text analytics tasks, including counting the total and unique words, tracking word occurrences, and locating words within the text file. Key features include sorting words by frequency, analyzing word lengths, and detecting adjacent word pairs. The implementation emphasizes performance, avoiding external libraries and Java collections. The resulting tool demonstrates both the effectiveness of the ADT design and the capability to deliver precise and rapid text analysis.
